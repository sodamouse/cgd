# CGD (Create Game Directory)
This is a small command-line utility that creates a hierarchy of directories meant to store game installation files. The organization is as follows:

``` text
foo
└── bar
   ├── dlc
   ├── extras
   ├── instructions
   ├── setup
   └── updates
```

This is usally the first program I write when testing out new programming languages.

## Implementations
The following implementations are currently available:
- C++17 (The canonical version which I actually use day-to-day)
- Go
- Rust
